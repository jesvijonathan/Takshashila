# [Takshashila](https://github.com/jesvijonathan/Takshashila)
CIT's [best developer](https://jesvi.pythonanywhere.com) builds the most elegant [webpage](https://jesvijonathan.github.io/Takshashila-Website) designed for an institution in regards to 'Takshashila' event


## [Note] for Kangers

If you are a kanger who is about to steal my work.. just make sure to mention/credit me before you do so..
<br><br>
I need the credits, I put in alot of work building & developing this project, this project should stay alive, to the years to come..
<br><br>
You wont get much credit from f-ers from TK, so make sure to be benefited from knowledge & experience that you gain from the project your are working before expecting anything else

## [Note] For YOU

Do not change the design, they are <b>perfecto</b> ! 
<br><br> 
If it were me, I would create dashboard for [editing](https://www.cittakshashila.in/edit.html) the [events from event.json](https://github.com/jesvijonathan/Takshashila-Website/blob/master/events.json) for tk volunteers coz that saves alot of time for the team & is future proof.
<br>
As of updating the site to match the current year's theme, I would change the bg wallpaper and the motto/theme text under the title in main page, Most of em won't remember the previous year site as much as you who worked on it do, so yeah...
<br><br>
Also, i did a work on the [backend](https://github.com/jesvijonathan/Takshashila) for this project and had a working prototype ready but could not get it to production due to time constraints but i have a few words to say on it too, 
- Backend is one of the element that is kept as a base in the long run, 
- Keep the login/register simple & no crazy checks & verification, (scared of bots & hackers ? use OG cloudflare).
- Make sure it can handle 1-2k users concurrently, (trust me, this is important).
- Gpay/UPI it is, no one is gonna use credit cards for payment.. so make use of 1. Upi opener links initially | 2. Payment gateway & make it dynamic such that the api call link itself can carry the product detail/price
- Keep track of all user activity logs, freaking useful, especially to fight a dispute or analyse what the users are interested in

## Yabadeebadoo, will update the readme later...
